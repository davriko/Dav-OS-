## 💡 Coaching Philosophy

> "Systematic progress beats occasional intensity."

- **30 min/day** beats 4 hours on weekends
- **One topic per session** — deep beats wide
- **Write it down** — if it's not in the repo, it didn't happen
- **Weekly review** — every Sunday, update progress tracker
- **Monthly reset** — adjust priorities based on what's urgent
